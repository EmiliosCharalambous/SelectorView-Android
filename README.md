# SelectorView-Android

**Description**

This library was developed for fast and easy build of a list of attributes for selection.

The main idea is to pass the values that you want to display to the user and get a callback with the selected attributes.

There many are options to use, like pre-selected attributes, multiple selection, search through the attributes and customise
the whole appearance.
